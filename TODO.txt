o write a few prepackaged scripts
  o post on gists
  o post links on wiki
  o post main links in readme

o run script within own context?
o only update on actual file change? (instead of save)
  - possible with inotify (Inotify::MODIFY), see about other handlers

o use filesystem events for file monitoring (MA)
  o linux:   inotify (ruby-inotify)
  o osx:     fsevent (http://github.com/ymendel/fsevents/tree/master)
  o win:     Directory Management? NTFS Change Journal? ReadDirectoryChangesW?
  o *BSD:    kqueue? pnotify?
  o solaris: FEM?
  o fallback to current method when no other method is available
  o api will also need refactoring for clearer separation of functionality

o document source
  o rdoc or yard?
o single docs.watchr script for both rdoc and yard (just generate both always)

o respond to different file events
  o modified
  o created
  o deleted
  o etc.
  o watch(pattern, EVENT, &action)
