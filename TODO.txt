* search path for scripts
  * allows gems/plugins to bundle own scripts
  * use case: foca-protest gem includes /lib/protest.watchr
    -> $ watchr protest.watchr # will pick it up

* namespace global methods in bin/watchr

* reset default_action when reparsing script
  * def reset

* 1.9 compatibility

* version.watchr
  * sync versions (gemspec & Watchr::VERSION)

* sometimes an action is fired without a file being saved
  * buffer flushing issue?
  * libev issue?

* when a file is saved twice quickly, subsequent events are ignored.
  * seems like rev/libev drops the file watch

* test on other platforms
  x mswin
  x cygwin
  * bsd
  * osx
  * solaris

* write a few prepackaged scripts
  * post on gists
  * post links on wiki
  * post main links in readme

* eval script within own context?
  * use case: using <tt>path</tt> within script accesses Script#path

* respond to different file events?
  * modified
  * created
  * deleted
  * etc.
  * watch(pattern, EVENT, &action)
  * use case: a script updates a manifest file when a file is deleted

* memory profiling / benchmarks
