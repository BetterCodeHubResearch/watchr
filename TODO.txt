o write a few prepackaged scripts
  o post on gists
  o post links on wiki
  o post main links in readme

o run script within own context?
o only update on actual file change? (instead of save)
  - possible with inotify (Inotify::MODIFY), see about other handlers

o use filesystem events for file monitoring (MA)
  - linux:    inotify (ruby-inotify)
  - win:      Directory Management
  - *BSD/OSX: kqueue
  - solaris:  FEM?
  - fallback to current method when no other method is available
  - api will also need refactoring for clearer separation of functionality
  o libev (Rev)

o document source
  o rdoc or yard?
o single docs.watchr script for both rdoc and yard (just generate both always)

o respond to different file events
  o modified
  o created
  o deleted
  o etc.
  o watch(pattern, EVENT, &action)

o memory profiling / benchmarks
