===== Features

* respond to :added file event (needs ability to watch dirs)

* watchr -e       # watchr -e "watch('foo.gemspec') { system('gem build foo.gemspec') }"
* watchr --auto
* watchr --fetch

* write a few prepackaged scripts
  * post on gists
  * post links on wiki
  * post main links in readme

===== Bugs

* sometimes an action is fired without a file being saved
  * buffer flushing issue?
  * libev issue?
  * probably fixed with event type handling update, which ignores atime
    updates by defaults

* when a file is saved twice quickly, subsequent events are ignored.
  * seems like rev/libev drops the file watch

===== Other

* add tests for executable
* memory profiling / benchmarks
